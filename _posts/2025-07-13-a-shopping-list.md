After researching options for an HF antenna for home in [my last post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-07-12-ai-for-hf %}), I started making a list of things to procure:

| # | Item | Comments |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | [MCR COMMUNICATIONS DELTA 20 HP Multi Band Full Wave Loop Ham Radio Antenna](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/266703485111) | This was the cheaper of the two well-reviewed, suitable items. |
| 2 | [Delta / Next Telescopic pole Whip (telepole) 3-10 mtr](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/402019633579?var=671880359820) | I'd seen that someone on YouTube had also used these for antennas. I went for the 7m option, knowing I'd have to remove the top section. |
| 3 | [mini8 patch lead 3.65m 12' 50 Ohms rg8 cable 2 pl259 ham & cb Radio](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/204042198353) | Due to the short run and low frequencies, mini8 should be fine. Both my radio and Balun have SO239 connectors. |
| 4 | [FloPlast Push-Fit Pipe Clips Black 40mm 10 Pack (49193)](https://www.screwfix.com/p/49193) | The plan is to use these to fix the bottom of the poles to my shed/fence. |
| 5 | [FloPlast Push-Fit Pipe Clips Black 32mm 10 Pack (81918)](https://www.screwfix.com/p/81918) | As the diameter decreases, I'll use these for higher up the poles. |
| 6 | [Cloth Tape 27 Mesh Black 50m x 50mm (5201V)](https://www.screwfix.com/p/5201V) | I plan to tape the joint between each pole section, to keep the poles permanently extended. |
| 7 | [Easyfix Zinc-Plated Screw Eyes 12ga x 55mm 10 Pack (17867)](https://www.screwfix.com/p/17867) | This is for fixing the Balun to my house wall. |
| 8 | [Essentials Cable Ties Black 300mm x 4.5mm 100 Pack (31536)](https://www.screwfix.com/p/31536) |  |

I've ordered the components and I hope to put the antenna up at the weekend.
