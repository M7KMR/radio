# AI for HF

Having caught the HF bug recently, I've been inspired to look again at urban options for HF antennas. My constraints are that I live in a noisy urban area, and have a small, 8m x 5m garden.

Some reading and chats with others pointed me towards horizontal delta loop antennas for their low noise and efficient use of space. I came across this extremely detailed [Practical Antennas page](https://practicalantennas.com/theory/loop/full-wave/) which confirmed that this might be a good option. My 8m x 5m garden would be able to support a full-wave delta loop for 20m, with one side of 5m and two sides of 7.5m. The height of the antenna would likely be 5-6m.

Not having used amateur HF before, I wanted to check what kind of activity I might be able to hear using my proposed antenna.

I started off with the following query for [Gemini](gemini.google.com).

> List the amateur radio HF bands. For each band provide the below. 

> Give the wavelength and frequency range for each band. What bands are most popular? What bands are used for NVIS? What bands are used in daytime and nighttime? What are the popular modes on each band?

This query got me some useful information, but also gave the model some context about my interests for this conversation (HF bands, antennas, modes). I received a useful response, including this table:

| Band Name | Wavelength (approx.) | Frequency Range (MHz) | Most Popular | NVIS Use | Daytime/Nighttime | Popular Modes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 160 Meters (Top Band) | 160m | 1.8 - 2.0 | Less popular due to large antenna requirements | No | Nighttime (local to medium distance) | CW, SSB, FT8 |
| 80 Meters (75 Meters in US) | 80m | 3.5 - 4.0 | Very popular | Yes (especially at night) | Nighttime (regional to DX), Daytime (local) | SSB, CW, FT8, RTTY, Digital modes |
| 60 Meters | 60m | 5.3 - 5.4 (channelized in some regions) | Less popular, limited availability | Yes | Daytime & Nighttime (regional) | SSB, CW, FT8 |
| 40 Meters | 40m | 7.0 - 7.3 | Very popular | Yes (especially daytime) | Daytime (regional to medium DX), Nighttime (DX) | SSB, CW, FT8, RTTY, Digital modes |
| 30 Meters (WARC band) | 30m | 10.1 - 10.15 | Moderately popular | Less common, but possible | Daytime (DX) | CW, Digital modes (often contest-free) |
| 20 Meters | 20m | 14.0 - 14.35 | Most Popular HF Band | No | Daytime (Long-distance DX, often open 24/7 during good conditions) | SSB, CW, FT8, RTTY, Digital modes |
| 17 Meters (WARC band) | 17m | 18.068 - 18.168 | Moderately popular | No | Daytime (DX, similar to 20m but less crowded) | SSB, CW, FT8, Digital modes (contest-free) |
| 15 Meters | 15m | 21.0 - 21.45 | Popular, especially during high solar activity | No | Daytime (Long-distance DX) | SSB, CW, FT8, RTTY, Digital modes |
| 12 Meters (WARC band) | 12m | 24.89 - 24.99 | Less popular, but good for DX during high solar activity | No | Daytime (DX) | SSB, CW, FT8, Digital modes (contest-free) |
| 10 Meters | 10m | 28.0 - 29.7 | Popular during high solar activity, less active otherwise | No | Daytime (Long-distance DX, Sporadic E) | SSB, FM (upper part), CW, FT8, RTTY, Digital modes |

I followed up with some additional questions. First, I asked about the capabilities of my proposed antenna, I then asked it to summarise the information in another table for 80, 40 and 20m:

| Band Name | Wavelength (approx.) | Frequency Range (MHz) | Height in Wavelengths (at 5m) | DX Capability (at 5m height) | NVIS Capability (at 5m height) | Popular Modes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| 80 Meters | 80m | 3.5 - 4.0 | ≈0.0625λ (1/16 wave) | Very Poor. Radiation almost exclusively straight up or at very high angles; not suitable for consistent long-haul DX. | Excellent. Ideal height for strong, near-vertical radiation, perfect for reliable regional communication, especially at night. | SSB, CW, FT8 |
| 40 Meters | 40m | 7.0 - 7.3 | ≈0.125λ (1/8 wave) | Limited to regional DX, good for medium-range. Electrically very low, primarily high-angle radiation. Occasional DX possible but not consistent for long-haul. | Excellent. Ideal height for strong, near-vertical radiation, perfect for reliable regional communication, especially during the day. | SSB, CW, FT8 |
| 20 Meters | 20m | 14.0 - 14.35 | ≈0.25λ (1/4 wave) | Compromised for long-haul DX, better for shorter DX. While a full-wave loop, this height results in higher take-off angles (30-40+ degrees), limiting optimal intercontinental DX but still good for medium-range DX. | Poor. Too high in frequency for reliable NVIS propagation at typical NVIS distances. | SSB, CW, FT8 |

This table can now serve as my quick reference for my new antenna.

The full conversation transcript can be found [here](https://g.co/gemini/share/3ac771c08acd). I was quite surprised at the effectiveness of Gemini for this task. I'll definitely continue to use it for amateur radio, so I've since made a [Gemini Gem](https://gemini.google/overview/gems/?hl=en) to streamline future queries.

These are a few other things I think AI could help with:
- answering queries about equipment capabilities
- advising on cable and antenna selection (as in this example)
- helping with menu queries for radio equipment, and visualising menu trees
- generating illustrations for this blog
